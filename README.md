# planned-burns web map prototype

Currently, DELWP is having issues engaging with the community when talking about their Planned Burns project. General public living in remote areas where high risk of bush fire exists, are having a hard time to understand how the planned burns made by the department are helping. In addition, there are about 3 different maps around DELWP's website to get people inform about current, future and past burns making it difficult for general public to access them and get inform.

The project was design to create a functional prototype that will help the department to incorporate the different stages of Planned Burns with information on past, current and future burns in a more user-friendly and accessible mapping tool. This will hopefully provide the department with an overview of what the community needs to get easily inform through a better experience when identifying current burns around their locations, as well as, an interactive and educational overview of the reasons behind these burns.
